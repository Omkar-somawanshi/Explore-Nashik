    mapLink: "https://goo.gl/maps/123TrimbakLink",
    rating: 4.8,
    history: `The Trimbakeshwar Temple is an ancient Hindu temple, believed to have been constructed by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the 18th century. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines, where Lord Shiva is worshipped in the form of a Jyotirlingam or 'lingam of light'. The uniqueness of the Lingam here is its three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Rudra (Shiva). The temple is also significant as it is near the origin of the Godavari River, India's second-longest river.`,
    bestTime: `The best time to visit Trimbakeshwar Temple is during the winter months (October to March) when the weather is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing and pilgrimages. Shivaratri and the Simhastha Kumbh Mela (held every 12 years) are peak times for devotees. Avoid the monsoon season (June-September) if you prefer less rain, but the surrounding hills are lush and green during this period.`,
    localTips: `Dress modestly as it's a religious site. Be prepared for crowds, especially during festivals. Consider hiring a local guide for deeper insights. Footwear needs to be removed before entering the temple. Photography inside the sanctum is generally restricted.`,

Sula launched its first wines in 2000 and quickly gained recognition for its pioneering efforts and quality.

Over the years, Sula has expanded its operations, introduced new varietals, and established itself as the market leader.`,

During this period, you can participate in grape stomping, witness the wine-making process firsthand, and enjoy the pleasant weather. The Nashik Wine Festival (Sulafest) usually happens in February. Avoid visiting during the monsoon (June-September) due to heavy rains, although the lush greenery can be appealing.`,
